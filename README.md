## My process

I find it easier to build the desktop first and then do mobile that doesn't mean I don't have mobile design from the beginning, just that after I know the mobile layout I find easier to reach that point from the desktop sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to work with uneven layout.

### Continued development

Need to build this site again using Grid and see if I can improve on it.
